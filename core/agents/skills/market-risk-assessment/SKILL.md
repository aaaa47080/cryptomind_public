# Market Risk Assessment

## When to Use
When the user asks about overall market risk or sentiment:
- "Is broad-market risk high right now?"
- "Is the market panicking?"
- "Is it a good time to enter?"
- "How is crypto-market sentiment?"
- "Is there a bubble?"

## Method

### Step 1: Fear & greed index
- Crypto: `get_fear_and_greed_index`
  - 0–25: extreme fear (contrarian: could be a buy point)
  - 25–45: fear
  - 45–55: neutral
  - 55–75: greed
  - 75–100: extreme greed (caution warranted)
- Traditional finance: VIX data from the Economic Agent

### Step 2: Capital flow
- Crypto: `get_futures_data` — funding rate
  - Extreme positive rate → crowded long (pullback risk)
  - Extreme negative rate → crowded short (short-squeeze potential)
- Crypto: `get_defillama_tvl` — is capital flowing in or out

### Step 3: Market breadth
- Crypto: `get_crypto_market_cap` — total market-cap change
- Crypto: `get_trending_tokens` — which sectors capital is rotating into

### Step 4: Macro backdrop
- Central bank rates: `get_central_bank_rates`
- Economic calendar: `get_economic_calendar` — near-term major events

### Step 5: Comprehensive risk assessment
| Risk level | Condition |
|----------|------|
| 🟢 Low risk | Fear index < 25, neutral funding, stable TVL |
| 🟡 Medium risk | Fear index 25–55, normal volatility |
| 🟠 High risk | Fear index > 75, extreme funding, fast TVL expansion |
| 🔵 Extreme fear | Fear index < 10, possibly a bottom zone |

## Output Format
```
## Market Risk Assessment

### Fear & Greed Index
List the actual index value (out of 100) and the corresponding sentiment tier

### Derivatives & On-Chain
- Funding rate: positive or negative, with the actual value and interpretation
- TVL change: rising or falling, with the actual magnitude

### Market Cap
List total crypto market cap and the magnitude of change

**Risk level**: one of "low", "medium", "high"

⚠️ The above is risk assessment and does not constitute investment advice.

(All figures must be filled with the actual results returned by tools; for fields that cannot be retrieved, state "unavailable" directly — do not leave placeholder text and do not estimate on your own.)
```

## Conventions
- The fear index should state both the number and its "contrarian" meaning (extreme fear = potential buy point)
- Extreme funding-rate values (> 0.1% or < -0.05%) must always be flagged
- Use emoji for the risk level so the user can see it at a glance
- List only macro events in the next 1–2 weeks; anything farther out has little reference value
