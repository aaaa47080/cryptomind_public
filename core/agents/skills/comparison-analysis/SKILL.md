# Multi-Asset Comparison Analysis

## When to Use
When the user wants to choose between or understand the differences among two or more assets:
- "BTC vs ETH — which is better?"
- "Compare TSMC and MediaTek"
- "SOL vs AVAX"
- "Gold or Bitcoin as an inflation hedge?"

## Method

### Step 1: Fetch same-dimension data for each asset
For **every** asset, call the same combination of tools to ensure a consistent comparison baseline:
- Real-time price (the price tool for each market)
- Technicals (`technical_analysis`: trend, RSI)
- Fundamentals / market structure (market cap, supply, TVL, etc., by asset type)
- Recent news (`aggregate_news` / `google_news`)

### Step 2: Only compare dimensions backed by tool data
If a dimension has data for only one of the assets → mark that cell "no data";
**never** fabricate the other asset's number from training memory.

### Step 3: Give a contextualized conclusion
Don't just say "each has its pros and cons" — explain **which goal / risk profile suits which asset**.

## Output Format
```
### Asset Comparison
| Item | Asset A | Asset B |
|------|-------|-------|
| Current price | ... | ... |
| 24h / recent performance | ... | ... |
| Technicals | ... | ... |
| Fundamentals highlights | ... | ... |
| Risk level | ... | ... |

### Analysis Conclusion
[Contextual recommendation: which situation suits A, which suits B]

⚠️ The above is data-driven comparison analysis and does not constitute investment advice.
```

## Conventions
- Every number in the table must come from this tool call; if data is missing, write "no data"
- When the two assets are in different markets (e.g., coin vs TW stock), still use one table, but annotate market differences (trading hours, pricing currency)
- When comparing more than 3 assets, transpose the table (assets as rows, dimensions as columns) to avoid it being too wide
- The conclusion should not give specific buy/sell signals; give fit-for-context recommendations instead
