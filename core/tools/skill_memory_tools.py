"""Agent self-managed skills & memory tools (HITL-gated).

docs/plans/2026-08-10-agent-self-managed-skills-memory-design.md

Two tools:
- ``list_my_skills_memory`` (low risk, read-only, NO HITL): returns the user's own
  custom skills + remembered facts so the agent can answer "what do I have?".
- ``propose_custom_skill`` (high risk, HITL): returns a ``__needs_consent__`` marker
  for create/update/delete a custom skill. claw_loop intercepts the marker,
  ``interrupt()``s for consent, and writes only after the user approves.

The third write path — ``remember`` (memory) — lives in ``remember_tool.py`` and
uses the same marker pattern.

Key safety invariant: these tools NEVER take ``user_id`` as a parameter. The user
is read from the contextvar inside claw_loop at write time, so a prompt-injected
tool call cannot target another user's data. The tools only *propose*; the node
*writes*.
