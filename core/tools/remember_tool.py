"""remember tool — Hermes-style proactive memory (the agent decides what to remember).

Design (adapted from Hermes write_memory):
- **Proactive**: when the model judges "this user information is worth remembering",
  it calls this tool without the user asking.
- **Categorized**: category distinguishes preference/holding/fact/context;
  preference/holding are injected into the prompt first.
- **Compliant**: only records information the user volunteered; never records PII
  (ID number / password / private key); holdings are never auto-scraped from the
  wallet (TON Connect is a trust signal, not a memory source).
- **HITL-gated** (docs/plans/2026-08-10-agent-self-managed-skills-memory-design.md):
  the tool does NOT write directly. It returns a ``__needs_consent__`` marker; the
  claw_loop node intercepts it, ``interrupt()``s to show a consent card, and only
  writes after the user approves. This mirrors the ``clarify`` tool's marker
  pattern (tool-level ``interrupt()`` is infeasible because the inner agent has no
  checkpointer).

user_id source: via a contextvar (get_current_user_id), same mechanism as
key_resolver. base_react_agent sets up the current user context before the agent runs.

    """Remember important information about the user, or delete a previously remembered fact.

    mode='create' (default): remember new info. It is brought into the next
    conversation automatically to make answers more personalized.
    mode='delete': remove a previously remembered fact. Pass its 'key' (obtained
    from list_my_skills_memory, which shows each fact as '[key] (category) value').

    When to proactively call this tool with mode='create' (to remember):
    - The user explicitly states an investment preference: "I always look at technicals", "I prefer conservative investing"
    - The user's investment background: "I mainly trade crypto", "I'm a long-term holder"
    - The user's holdings (volunteered): "I hold 2.3 BTC", "I have TSLA"
    - A recurring pattern: the user asks about TW stocks several times in a row → remember they focus on TW stocks

    When to call with mode='delete':
    - The user explicitly asks to forget/remove/clear a remembered fact.
    - First call list_my_skills_memory to get the [key], then call this with mode='delete' and that key.

    When NOT to remember (just answer directly, do not call this tool):
    - Answers to one-off questions ("what's BTC right now" is not worth remembering)
    - Market facts that are easy to look up again (what NVDA does, today's index level)
    - Sensitive personal data (ID number, password, private key, seed phrase) — NEVER record these

    The user must approve before it is actually stored/removed — you are *proposing*.

    Args:
      content: the information to remember (concise, specific). Required for mode='create'.
      category: preference / holding / context / fact (mode='create' only).
